For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield)

D- DU -U DU

Intro

[E] [A] 
[E] [A] 

[E] There's something happening here [A]
But what it [E] is ain't exactly clear [A]
There's a [E] man with a gun over there [A]
Telling [E] me I got to beware [A] 

It's time we [E] stop
Children, what's [D] that sound?
[A] Everybody look, what's going [C] down?

[E] [A] 
[E] [A]

[E] There's battle lines being [A] drawn
Nobody's [E] right if everybody's [A] wrong
[E] Young people speaking their [A] minds
Getting [E] so much resistance [A] from behind

It's time we [E] stop
Hey, [D] what's that sound?
[A] Everybody look, what's going down?
[E] [A] [E] [A]

[E] What a field day for the [A] heat
A thousand people in the street 
Singing songs and they carrying signs
Mostly say, "Hooray for our side" 

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

[E] [A] 
[E] [A]

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the men come and take you away

We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
You better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
You better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
You better stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

A [F] thousand miles seems pretty far
But [G] they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd [C] walk to you if I had no other [Am] way
Our [F] friends would all make fun of us
And [G] we'll just laugh along because
We [C] know that none of them have felt this [Am] way
De[F]lilah, I can promise you
That [G] by the time we get through
The [Am] world will never, ever be the same
And you're to [G] blame ee

Just [G] nod if you can [Em] hear me
Is there [Bm] anyone at home?

[C] You are only coming through in [G] waves
Your [C] lips move, but I can't hear what you're [G] saying

When [D] I was a child, I had a [A] fever
My [D] hands felt just like two [A] balloons
[C] Now I've got that feeling once [G] again

I do believe it's [A] working, good
That'll keep you [G] going through [Em] the show
Come [Bm] on, it's time to go

[D] There is no pain, you are [A] receding
[D] A distant ship smoke on the [A] horizon
[C] You are only coming through in [G] waves
Your [C] lips move, but I can't hear what you're [G] saying

When [D] I was a child, I caught a fleeting [A] glimpse
[D] Out of the corner of my [A] eye
[C] I turned to look, but it was [G] gone
I cannot put my finger [C] on it now
The child is grown, the [G] dream is gone

[A] I [C] have become [G] comfortably [D] numb

Last Kiss (Pearl Jam)

[G] [Em] [C] [D]

Well, [G] where oh where can my [Em] baby be?
[C] The Lord took her [D]away from me.
[G] She's gone to heaven, so I've [Em] got to be good,
So [C] I can see my baby when I [D] leave this [G] world.

We were [G] out on a date in my [Em]daddy's car.
[C] We hadn't driven [D]very far.
[G] There in the road, [Em]straight ahead...
A trooper[C] car was stalled, the [D]engine was dead.
[G] I couldn't stop, so I [Em]swerved to the right.
[C] I'll never forget the [D]sounds that night...
The [G] cryin' tires, the [Em]bustin' glass.
The [C]painful scream that [D] I heard [G]last.

Oh, [G] where oh where can my [Em] baby be?
[C] The Lord took her [D]away from me.
[G] She's gone to heaven, so I've [Em] got to be good,
So [C] I can see my baby when I [D] leave this [G] world.

[G] When I woke up, the rain was [Em] pourin' down.
[C] There were people standing all [D] around.
[G] Something warm was runnin' [Em] in my eyes,
[C] But I found my baby some [D] how that [G] night.
[G] I raised her head, and then she smiled [Em] and said,
[G] "Hold me darling for a [D] little while."
[G] I held her close. I kissed her [Em] our last kiss.
[C] I found the love that I [D] knew I would [D] miss.
[G] But now she's gone, even though I [Em] hold her tight.
[C] I lost my love ... my [D] life, that [G] night.

Well, [G] where oh where can my [Em] baby be?
[C] The Lord took her [D]away from me.
[G] She's gone to heaven, so I've [Em] got to be good,
So [C] I can see my baby when I [D] leave this [G] world.

Ooh oooh ohhh (to the tune of the chorus)

Everyday Is Like Sunday (Morrissey)

[G] Trudging slowly over [C] wet sand
Back to the [G] bench where your clothes were [C] stolen
This is the coastal town [D] 
That they for[G]got to close [C] down
Armageddon, [Em] come Armageddon
Come, Armageddon, [C] come

[G] Every [D] day is like [C] Sunday
[G] Every [D] day is silent [C] and grey

Hide on the promenade, etch a postcard
"How I dearly wish I was not here"
In the seaside town
That they forgot to bomb
Come, come, come, nuclear bomb

Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Trudging back over pebbles and sand
And a strange dust lands on your hands
And on your face
On your face
On your face
On your face

Everyday is like Sunday
"Win yourself a cheap tray"
Share some greased tea with me
Everyday is silent and grey

Heartbreak Hotel - Elvis Presley
Well, since my baby left me [E],
I found a new place to dwell [E].
It's down at the end of lonely street
at Heartbreak Hotel.

You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.

And although it's always crowded,
you still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers
do cry away their gloom.

You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.

Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',
and the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back.

You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.

Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
and you got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street
to Heartbreak Hotel.
