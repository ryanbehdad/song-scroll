For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield)

D- DU -U DU

[E] [A] [E] [A] (instead of [A] can play [A7])

[E] There's something happening here [A]
But what it [E] is ain't exactly clear [A]
There's a [E] man with a gun over there [A]
Telling [E] me I got to beware [A] 

It's time we [E] stop
Children, what's [D] that sound?
[A] Everybody look, what's going [C] down?

[E] [A] [E] [A]

[E] There's battle lines being [A] drawn
Nobody's [E] right if everybody's [A] wrong
[E] Young people speaking their [A] minds
Getting [E] so much resistance [A] from behind

It's time we [E] stop
Hey, [D] what's that sound?
[A] Everybody look, what's going down?
[E] [A] [E] [A]

[E] What a field day for the [A] heat (Ooh ooh ooh)
A thousand people in the street (Ooh ooh ooh)
Singing songs and they carrying signs (Ooh ooh ooh)
Mostly say, "Hooray for our side" (Ooh ooh ooh)

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

[E] [A] [E] [A]

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the men come and take you away

We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
You better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
You better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
You better stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

[G] [Em] [C] [D]

Oh, [G] where oh where can my [Em] baby be?
The [C] Lord took her aw[D]ay from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, up straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I heard last.

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standing all around
Something warm rollin' through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
"Hold me darling just a little while."
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night.

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.

Bad Moon Rising  (Creedence Clearwater Revival and Creedence Clearwater Revived)

I see the bad moon a-risin'
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I fear rivers over flowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise, alright

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't come around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Everyday Is Like Sunday (Morrissey)

[G] Trudging slowly over [C] wet sand
Back to the [G] bench where your clothes were [C] stolen
This is the coastal town [D] 
That they for[G]got to close [C] down
Armageddon, [Em] come Armageddon
Come, Armageddon, [C] come

[G] Every [D] day is like [C] Sunday
[G] Every [D] day is silent [C] and grey

Hide on the promenade, etch a postcard
"How I dearly wish I was not here"
In the seaside town
That they forgot to bomb
Come, come, come, nuclear bomb

Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Trudging back over pebbles and sand
And a strange dust lands on your hands
And on your face
On your face
On your face
On your face

Everyday is like Sunday
"Win yourself a cheap tray"
Share some greased tea with me
Everyday is silent and grey

Heartbreak Hotel - Elvis Presley
Well, since my baby left me [E],
I found a new place to dwell [E].
It's down at the end of lonely street
at Heartbreak Hotel.

You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.

And although it's always crowded,
you still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers
do cry away their gloom.

You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.

Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',
and the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back.

You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.

Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
and you got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street
to Heartbreak Hotel.
